## Algorithm

**Problem** [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

### Solution 1:  Brute Force

We can write the solution in a second.

```Java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
            if (nums[j] == target - nums[i]) {
                return new int[] { i, j };
            }
        }
    }
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("No two sum solution");
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**
- Time complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
- Space complexity: O(1)

### Solution 2:  Two-pass Hash Table

An suggestion can be shared here:  When you have a problem to solve, then think **Hash** first!

```Java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement) && map.get(complement) != i) {
            return new int[] { i, map.get(complement) };
        }
    }
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("No two sum solution");
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(n)

## Review

The first article I want to learn or share is [Youth](https://www.uab.edu/ullmanmuseum/) which I read long long ago.

> Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees; it is a matter of the will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep springs of life.

## Tip

I have no tip to share this time.

## Share
It is not uncommon that we have more thant 1 git account for all kinds of purposes and switch accounts frequently. So let me share a way to use multiple **ssh-key**.

### Generate a new SSH key

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "XXX@XX.com"

and then input the file path, for example `J1031-rsa`.
Repeat the step and select another path, for example `t1031-rsa`.

### Adding a new SSH key to your account

Github instructions can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

### Config

Config host in the file **~/.ssh/config**, example is as follows.

    # github
    Host github.com
        HostName github.com
        PreferredAuthentications publickey
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/J1031-rsa
    # xxx
    Host xxx.com
        HostName xxx.com
        PreferredAuthentications publickey
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/t1031-rsa
